# Contributing

Thanks for checking out this project! I built this as a learning project for my debate practice, but I'm happy if others find it useful too.

## About This Project

I'm a freshman in high school learning to code with help from AI tools (Microsoft Copilot) and my dad. This project helped me understand how web apps work and how to make product decisions about what features actually matter.

## If You Want to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If something doesn't work, please open an issue and include:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Your operating system
- Error messages if any

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea? Open an issue and describe:
- What problem it would solve
- How you think it should work

I might not be able to implement everything (still learning!), but I appreciate the suggestions.

### Code Contributions

If you want to submit code:

1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch
2. **Make your changes**
3. **Test that it works**
4. **Create a pull request** explaining what you changed and why

**Code style:**
- Python: Try to follow PEP 8 (I use Black for formatting)
- TypeScript: Follow the ESLint rules in the project
- Add comments for complex parts

**Commit messages:** Keep them clear:
- `fix: resolve microphone permission issue`
- `feat: add export to PDF`
- `docs: update setup instructions`

## Getting Set Up

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for how to run the project locally.

You'll need:
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- FFmpeg
- An AI provider API key (Gemini is free and works well)

## Areas That Could Use Help

These are things I know could be better but haven't figured out yet:

**High Priority:**
- Better error handling when audio files are weird formats
- Making the UI more responsive on mobile
- Adding tests (I know I should have more tests)

**Medium Priority:**
- Real-time analysis while recording
- Saving analysis history
- Prettier UI design

**Nice to Have:**
- Export as PDF
- Support for more languages
- Performance improvements

## Questions?

Feel free to open a discussion or issue if you have questions. I'll try to respond when I can, but I'm also in school and on the debate team, so it might take a bit.

## Recognition

If you contribute, you'll show up in the GitHub contributors list automatically. Thanks for helping make this better!

**Learning Note:** I'm still figuring out a lot of this stuff. If you see something that could be done better, that's probably because I'm learning. Constructive feedback is always welcome!
