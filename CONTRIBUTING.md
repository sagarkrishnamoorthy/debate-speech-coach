# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project. I built this for debate practice, but I'm happy if others find it useful.

## Reporting Issues

If something doesn't work:
- Describe what you were trying to do
- Include error messages if any
- Mention your OS (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- Note which AI provider you're using

## Suggesting Features

Open an issue describing:
- What problem the feature would solve
- How you think it should work

I might not implement everything right away, but I appreciate the ideas.

## Code Contributions

If you want to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes and test them
4. Submit a pull request explaining what changed and why

**Code style:**
- Python: Follow PEP 8 (I use Black for formatting)
- TypeScript: Follow the ESLint config
- Add comments for non-obvious logic

**Commit message format:**
```
type: brief description

Examples:
fix: resolve microphone permission on Safari
feat: add pause/resume for recording
docs: update setup instructions for Windows
```

## Development Setup

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for how to run locally.

Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- FFmpeg
- AI provider API key

## Areas for Improvement

Things that could be better:

**High Priority:**
- Better error messages for audio format issues
- Mobile-responsive UI
- More comprehensive tests

**Medium Priority:**
- Real-time analysis during recording
- Save analysis history
- Export results as PDF

**Lower Priority:**
- Additional language support
- Performance optimizations
- UI design improvements

## Questions

Open a discussion or issue if you have questions. I'm in school and on the debate team, so responses might take a day or two.
